## Prompts Used for Project Generation

Here are the prompts used to guide the AI in generating the PlantPal project.

### 1.  Comprehensive Software Development Project Plan

**Prompt:**

"Create a comprehensive software development project plan for a website called 'PlantPal'. The website should provide users with basic care information for a variety of plants. Follow all stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and include detailed specifications for each stage.

**Specifically:**

* **Project Planning:**
    * Define project goals, scope, objectives, target audience, stakeholders, timeline, milestones, feasibility analysis (technical and economic), and deliverables.
* **Requirements Gathering:**
    * Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements. The website should include:
        * Search functionality with a prominent search bar.
        * A predefined list of 100 common flowers (provide the list).
        * A display area for plant care information (watering frequency, light requirements, soil type) or an error message if the plant is not found.
        * A 'Home' button to return to the initial state.
* **Use Case Definition:**
    * Define at least three use cases (e.g., searching for a plant, using the Home button, handling a plant not found) with detailed descriptions and diagrams.
* **System and UI Design:**
    * Design the system architecture (frontend/backend components), create UI wireframes/mockups, and specify technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend framework). Address usability, accessibility, and responsiveness.
* **User Personas:**
    * Create at least two user personas with names, ages, technical skills, goals, and pain points.
* **Code Implementation:**
    * Generate well-structured and commented code for the frontend and backend, implementing all required functionality and including basic error handling.
* **Test Scripts:**
    * Generate test scripts with test cases and expected results for all core functionality (search, Home button, error handling, responsiveness).
* **Documentation:**
    * Generate a comprehensive README.md file, a planning.md file with all non-code content, and a prompts.pdf file.
* **Contracts and Artifacts:**
    * Generate a basic project contract and any other relevant artifacts like a data dictionary.
* **Deployment:**
    * Provide instructions and files for deploying the frontend on Netlify and the backend on Vultr (or suggest alternatives).

The AI should provide detailed outputs for each of these sections."

### 2.  JSON List of 100 Common Flowers

**Prompt:**

"Provide a JSON list of 100 common flowers, including their common names. This list will be used as the database for the PlantPal website."

### 3.  Detailed Prompt for Home Button and Search

**Prompt:**

"Generate a detailed prompt to ensure the 'PlantPal' website includes a prominently displayed 'Home' button on the results page. The prompt should also specify that the website must allow users to search for plant information using a text input field and display the search results dynamically."

### 4.  SDLC Stages for PlantPal

**Prompt:**

"Incorporate the following Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) stages into the project plan for the 'PlantPal' website. The AI should generate detailed content for each stage, as outlined below:

* Project planning
* Requirements gathering
* Use case definition
* System and UI design
* User personas
* Code implementation
* Test scripts
* Documentation
* Contracts and any additional relevant artifacts

The AI should also generate a README.md file with a project title, description, functional documentation, and placeholders for visuals/diagrams. Additionally, create a markdown file ('planning.md') for all AI-generated non-code content and a PDF ('prompts.pdf') containing the prompts used."

### 5.  Alternative Unique Names

**Prompt:**

"Suggest several alternative unique names for a website that helps users find basic care information for their plants. Provide a list of at least 10 alternative names."

### 6.  More Unique and Creative Names

**Prompt:**

"Generate more unique and creative names for a plant care website, avoiding common terms like 'plant' and 'garden' if possible. Provide a list of at least 10 alternative names."

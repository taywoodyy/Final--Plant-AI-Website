# PlantPal Project Planning and Documentation

## I. Project Planning

### Project Goals

* To create a user-friendly website that provides accurate and concise plant care information.
* To empower users to confidently care for their plants.
* To develop a functional web application using AI-assisted development.

### Project Scope

The project scope includes the development of a website with the following features:

* A searchable database of 100 common plants.
* Display of basic care information (watering, light, soil) for searched plants.
* A "Home" button for easy navigation.

### Project Objectives

* Deliver a functional website within the given timeframe.
* Ensure the website is user-friendly and accessible.
* Utilize AI for code generation and documentation.

### Target Audience and Stakeholders

* **Target Audience:** Plant owners of all levels, from beginners to experienced gardeners.
* **Stakeholders:**
    * The users of the website.
    * The developer (in this case, the AI and the user guiding the AI).

### Project Timeline and Milestones

*(Note: AI can generate a more detailed timeline. This is a placeholder.)*

* Phase 1:  Requirements gathering and planning (Day 1-2)
* Phase 2:  System and UI design (Day 2-3)
* Phase 3:  Code implementation (Day 3-5)
* Phase 4:  Testing and documentation (Day 5-6)
* Phase 5:  Deployment (Day 7)

### Feasibility Analysis

* **Technical Feasibility:** The project is technically feasible using standard web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a simple backend framework. AI can assist with code generation.
* **Economic Feasibility:** The project can be developed with minimal cost, primarily involving time and effort in guiding the AI.

## II. Requirements Gathering

### Functional Requirements

* The website shall allow users to search for plant care information by plant name.
* The website shall display care information, including watering, light, and soil recommendations.
* The website shall provide a "Home" button to return to the main search page.
* The website shall display an error message if a plant is not found.
* The website shall be responsive and accessible on different devices.

### Non-Functional Requirements

* The website shall be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
* The website shall have a clean and modern design.
* The website shall load quickly.
* The website shall be maintainable.

### Constraints and Assumptions

* The website will initially contain information for 100 common plants.
* Users are assumed to know the common name of the plant they are searching for.
* A stable internet connection is required to access the website.

## III. Use Case Definition

### Use Case 1: Search for Plant Information

* **Description:** A user wants to find care information for a specific plant.
* **Actor:** User
* **Preconditions:** The user is on the homepage.
* **Postconditions:** The care information for the plant is displayed, or an error message is shown.
* **Main Flow:**
    1.  The user enters the plant name in the search bar.
    2.  The user clicks the search button (or presses Enter).
    3.  The website searches the plant database.
    4.  If the plant is found, the website displays the care information.
    5.  If the plant is not found, the website displays an error message.

### Use Case 2: Return to Homepage

* **Description:** A user wants to clear the search results and return to the homepage.
* **Actor:** User
* **Preconditions:** The user is on the results page.
* **Postconditions:** The user is on the homepage, and the search bar is empty.
* **Main Flow:**
    1.  The user clicks the "Home" button.
    2.  The website clears the search bar and displays the homepage.

### Use Case 3: Plant Not Found

* **Description:** A user searches for a plant that is not in the database.
* **Actor:** User
* **Preconditions:** The user is on the homepage.
* **Postconditions:** An error message is displayed.
* **Main Flow:**
    1.  The user enters the plant name in the search bar.
    2.  The user clicks the search button.
    3.  The website searches the plant database.
    4.  The website does not find the plant.
    5.  The website displays an error message.

## IV. System and UI Design

### System Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

* **Frontend:** The user interface, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Handles user input and displays output.
* **Backend:** The server-side logic, built using [Flask/Node.js/Express].  Handles the plant data and search functionality.

The frontend sends a request to the backend with the plant name.  The backend processes the request, retrieves the plant information from the database, and sends the response back to the frontend.  The frontend then displays the information to the user.

### UI Design

* **Homepage:**
    * A prominent search bar in the center of the page.
    * A clear call to action (e.g., "Enter plant name to find care information").
    * A simple and uncluttered layout.
* **Results Page:**
    * The plant name is displayed at the top of the page.
    * Care information (watering, light, soil) is displayed in a clear and organized format.
    * A "Home" button is provided for navigation.
    * A consistent design with the homepage.

### Technologies Used

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Backend: [Flask/Node.js/Express]
* Data Storage:  [In-memory data structure, or JSON file]

## V. User Personas

### User Persona 1: The Novice Plant Owner

* **Goals:** To keep her newly acquired plants alive and healthy.
* **Pain Points:** Overwhelmed by conflicting plant care advice, unsure of basic care requirements.

### User Persona 2: The Experienced Gardener

* **Name:** John
* **Age:** 50
* **Technical Skills:** Comfortable with using websites and online tools.
* **Goals:** To quickly find specific care information for a wide variety of plants.
* **Pain Points:** Frustrated by having to consult multiple sources for plant care information.
